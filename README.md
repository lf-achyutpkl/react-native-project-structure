# react-native-project-structure
Project structure for building android and ios app using React Native.

Since react-native cli does not provide project structure for js code, so it might be daunting for new developers to orgranize project.

The goal of this structure is:
* Cross Platform
* Maximum code reuse
* Minimize component state
* Keep configuration out of the code
